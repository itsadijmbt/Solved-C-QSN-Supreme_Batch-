An exponential search is based on the fact that we derive a sub array that reduces the time comolecity for very long arrays.

Code Snippet :

if(a[0]==x)
return 0;
int i=0 //i initilaised with 1 as i=i*2 for exponnetial if it would be zero than no expo

while(i<n && a[i]<=x)
{
   i=i*2;//i=i<<1;
}
this moves the i exponential ahead depending whether it finds a number bigger or it reaxches end

now note if we do get the sub-array it would start at i/2 and end at i as i gets 2X;

return binary_search(a,min(i,n-1),x);
//min done for the case if i was = n-1 or n-2 then 2*(n-1) or any other term would give error

<<REST IS SAME BINARY SEARCH>>
