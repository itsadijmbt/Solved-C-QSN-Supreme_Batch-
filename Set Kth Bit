QSN:
Set the kth bit

SOlUTION : we use a mask and bitwise or it with the number 

eg 10 = 1 0 1 0
and set 2nd bit means 1 1 1 0 that means we did nt disturb any other bit and thats only possible when we use OR
because OR ensurses 0|0 = 0 and 1|1 = 1 and  0|1=1 applies where we waant to set the bit..


MASKING is done by shifting 1 by Kth position towards left 1<<Kth 

SOLUTION CODE:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  
  int test_case=0;
  cin>>test_case;
  while(test_case--){
   int number=0,pos=0,mask=0;
   cin>>number>>pos;
  
    mask=1<<pos;
   int ans=number | mask;
   cout<<ans<<"\n";
  }
    return 0;
}
